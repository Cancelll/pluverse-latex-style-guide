### Short Column Width

Keep a line short. I would recommend to break a line at 60. The benefits of doing this are

- Friendly to version control system. Easy to diff. 
- Better bi-directional mapping between the output pdf file and the latex source.
- Friendly to the editor. No need to use the editor's wrapping functionality.

### Decompose a single BIG .tex file into multiple .tex files

- Friendly to version control system. Easy to diff. Minimize merge conflicts.
- Better organization of the paper, for example, each section is in its own file.

### Have a main.tex file

- Easy to identify the entry of the tex project.

### Use '~' between the words and '\cite', and '\ref'.

### Put captions above tables, and below figures.
